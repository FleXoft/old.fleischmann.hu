Now the funeral is over<br>
And all the tears are dried up<br>
Niggas hangin deep on the cut gettin fired up<br>
Lookin for the nigga who pulled his pistol on my homie<br>
An eye for an eye so now your life is what you owe me<br>
Look deep into the eyes of your motherfucking killa<br>
I want you to witness your motherfucking murda nigga<br>
And since you wants to kill then your ass has gots to fry<br>
But ain't no police therefore your ass has gots to die<br>
We play the game for keeps and if you slipped I guess you sleep<br>
You showed no fuckin now your ass is six feet deep<br>
Cuz where I come from yo everybody's gotta gat<br>
And niggas try your ass just to see where you got your heart at<br>
And if your shit is flimsy then your ass is gonna bend<br>
And like I said before they'll be no tears in the end<br>
I'm rollin through your hood and now my heart is filled with anger<br>
You at your sister's house now your sister's life's in danger<br>
(By a total stranger)<br>
With tha gang<br>
Niggas wanna bang ya<br>
And hang ya<br>
Stain ya wit one up in the chamber<br>
Let's take a trip up Holaway<br>
So you can see how many niggas in my hood is down to die today<br>
We standin' up for our own shit<br>
And if you outside the click then you die bitch<br>
(Quick)<br>

It ain't no love in this motherfucker<br>
It ain't no love for yourself or your other brother<br>
Uh because we real with this shit so we stay true<br>
And since we bang then we do what O.G. say do<br>
I've got the mind of the man in the mirror so I'm lookin' at me vaguely<br>
But I can't seem to fade me<br>
I've got my pistol pawn cocked<br>
Ready ta lay shots nonstop until I see your monkey ass drop<br>
And let your homies know who done it<br>
Cuz when it comes to this gangsta shit you motherfuckers know who run it<br>
(Uh)<br>
So when you put this motherfucker to the test<br>
You gotta realize somethin' nigga: you fuckin' wit the very best<br>
I got this killa up inside of me<br>
I can't talk to my mother so I talk to my diary<br>
I'm goin' off on the deep end<br>
I found myself face to face with myself while I'm sleepin'<br>
I see your picture in my head and my hand shake<br>
You can run, you can hide, but there's no escape<br>
My inner feelings show no mercy on my enemy<br>
I got to get this mutherfucker fore he gets to me<br>
So in your own blood you'll bathe<br>
And I won't stop until I put this mutherfucker in his fuckin' grave<br>
And I can say this once again<br>
You can cry but you'll still die<br>
They'll be no tears in the end<br>
