(Typing) Yo whaddup Bangs? (yo) Check out the new beat.<br>
<br>
Sniper Twins Presents...<br>
<br>
My desktop is the best top,<br>
nothing less but, check my desk bra<br>
killer machine.<br>
<br>
That's a G5 clean and white,<br>
250 gigabyte, gig of RAM,<br>
kill a man, 20 inch screen.<br>
<br>
Wanna burn a disc?<br>
How about a DVD?<br>
Wirelessly? Check my P.O.P.<br>
<br>
166.2467<br>
And if there's ever a problem,<br>
I call my tech man Devon.<br>
<br>
Yo, Devon man what you doing tonight?<br>
Come over to my crib,<br>
these permissions ain't right.<br>
Check out the back of my CPU,<br>
I got more ports than a wi-store do.<br>
<br>
Let's talk mouse,<br>
and let's talk keys...<br>
blue tooth rays<br>
compute through the breeze.<br>
<br>
With my desktop, hey,<br>
I compute with ease.<br>
Think your laptop stand a chance bro?<br>
Please.<br>
<br>
I'm gonna buy...baby,<br>
a new disk drive...lady.<br>
a 1.5 Terabyte<br>
Stack the memory to the sky.<br>
<br>
It's been a while...baby.<br>
On the 30 day trial...lady.<br>
It's probably time for us to fly,<br>
hit that PayPal and comply<br>
<br>
Come on take a ride on the Super Highway,<br>
Information you're craving,<br>
Your keyboard's like a sine wave.<br>
Enter, Escape or break this screen<br>
if your computer freezes up,<br>
hit Control Alt Delete.<br>
You can reboot, reload, restart, and refigure.<br>
Your motherboard's crashing<br>
while my ?? gets bigger.<br>
I bust through your fire wire<br>
with my fire storm,<br>
no net ?? protects kid from this viral.<br>
Get your Norton, your Symantec, and your McAfee,<br>
Got a hailstorm of popups<br>
now you're mad at me.<br>
OMG BRB when I chat is my protocol,<br>
Keep 'em all in stitches<br>
with my smiley face emoticons.<br>
Like a Robotron I'm gonna stay multitasking,<br>
go to message boards for my class (what they asking?)<br>
Gotta research why they murders and death counts,<br>
better reconnect my proxy server...<br>

I supply (baby), a new disk drive (lady),<br>
1.5 Terabyte, stack the memory to the sky.<br>
It's been a while (baby), the 30 day trial (lady),<br>
It's probably time for us to buy,<br>
hit that PayPal and comply...<br>
<br>
I got double your RAM, ask your man,<br>
my home office look like a space ship damn.<br>
Your girls gotta busted Myspace pic damn,<br>
Your whole PC needs a facelift man.<br>
<br>
D-d-d-d-d-d-dippin these digits and switching these keys,<br>
?? around you for you, see me suffer for free,<br>
downloading diamond bundles from his FTP,<br>
plugging in plug-ins and VST.<br>
Pre-amp these vocals lay 'em down on track 3.<br>
<br>
(Hey, do you have those reports yet?)<br>
<br>
So I'm covering my tracks from the inter-police,<br>
and I'm watching my black making black market beats<br>
with my refurbished amp plugged in USB,<br>
mass-appealing to the fans going P2P.<br>
<br>
D&B on the mic and I need more power,<br>
so patch it right in to my workstation tower.<br>
Megahertz pumping through my ??? on an amp,<br>
pumping these beats and kicking these jams.<br>
Fight my fiber-optic cable and ethernet,<br>
my quadruple core processor's working up a sweat.<br>
Something's slowing down my system that I can't even see,<br>
My folder's full of cookies eating up my memory.<br>
<br>
It's time to buy (baby) a new disk drive (lady),<br>
1.5 Terabyte, stack the memory to the sky.<br>
It's been a while (baby), the 30 day trial (lady),<br>
