Let's pretend that we'll be here tomorrow<br>
And I'll try for you to be a little more on time<br>
I know you need to say you know you've let me down<br>
But you haven't and it's hard to talk with people all around<br>
<br>
Please don't say how proud you are<br>
Lets do the things we normally do<br>
I'll say see you later<br>
You'll sing a line or two<br>
From your rebel songs sung out of tune<br>
<br>
Don't hold my hand for longer than you need to<br>
<br>
Lets forget that we're here and make some plans<br>
We'll go for walks<br>
Sit on the bench we always sat<br>
I'll tell you every little detail of my day and so will you<br>
Don't try to stay awake<br>
I'm feeling tired too<br>
<br>
This is just another day<br>
Let's do the things we normally do<br>
<br>
I'll say see you later you'll sing a line or two<br>
From your rebel songs sung out of tune<br>

Don't hold my hand for longer than you need to<br>
<br>
Armored cars and tanks and guns came to take away our sons<br>
And everybody's stood behind<br>
The man behind the wire<br>
There's a fight to love<br>
A fight to have<br>
Your bed's a battlefield and back<br>
And all of this will just be stripped away<br>
<br>
Let's do the things we normally do<br>
I'll say see you later you'll sing a line or two<br>
From your rebel songs sung out of tune<br>
Don't hold my hand for longer than you need to<br>
<br>
Don't look me in the eye more than you need to<br>
<br>
Don't try to say goodbye if I don't want to<br>
Don't say how proud you are<br>
And say I'm far away<br>
and take along your<br>
and say a word<br>
and I can say fade away<br>
