This was a triumph<br>
I'm making a note here<br>
HUGE SUCCESS<br>
It's hard to overstate my satisfaction<br>
Aperture Science<br>
<br>
we do what we must because we can<br>
for the good of all of us except for the ones who are dead<br>
but there's no sense crying over every mistake<br>
you just keep on trying until you run out of cake<br>
and the science gets done and you make a neat gun<br>
for the people who are still alive<br>
<br>
I'm not even angry<br>
I'm being so sincere right now<br>
even though you broke my heart and killed me<br>
and torn into pieces<br>
and threw every piece into a fire<br>
as they burned it hurt because I was so happy for you!<br>
Now these points of data make a wonderful line<br>
and we're out of beta, we're releasing on time<br>
so I'm glad I got burned<br>
Think of all the things we learned for the people that are still alive<br>

go ahead and leave me<br>
I think I prefer to stay inside<br>
maybe you'll find someone else to help you<br>
maybe black mesa<br>
that was a joke, haha, fat chance<br>
anyway this cake is great, it's so delicious and moist<br>
look at me still talking, when there's science to do<br>
when I look out there it makes me glad I'm not you<br>
I've experiments to run, there is research to be done<br>
on the people who are still alive<br>
<br>
and believe me I am still alive<br>
I'm doing science and I'm still alive<br>
I feel FANTASTIC and I'm still alive<br>
While you are dying I'll be still alive<br>
and when you're dead I'll be still alive<br>
STILL ALIVE, still alive<br>
