<u>JUNGLE BROTHERS - BECAUSE I GOT IT LIKE THAT</u>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">
A: Because I got it like that, uh huh<br>
Because I got it like that, wooh, uh huh<br>
Because I got it like that<br>
G: Like how?<br>
A: Like that<br>
Verse 1: Afrika, Mike G<br>
Dancin' on the dance floor<br>
Girl, it's you that I adore<br>
Step on stage, you scream for more<br>
Afrika got rhymes galore<br>
Snap my fingers, make you mine<br>
If not, I'll snap a second time<br>
After that, I guarantee<br>
You will be standing next to me<br>
Left or right side, take your pick<br>
But girl, you've got to make it quick<br>
Baby, baby, baby<br>
I know I drive you crazy<br>
MC's know me as Mike G<br>
Girls hold on to me tightly<br>
Warm personality<br>
That's why they get close to me<br>
Try their best to drive me wild<br>
Say they want to bear my child<br>
I go away, they say, Come back<br>
Why? Because I got it like that<br>
Chorus:<br>
A: Yeah, uh huh<br>
G: Because I got it like that<br>
A: Yeah, uh huh<br>
G: Because I got it like that<br>
A: A ha ha, uh huh<br>
G: Because I got it like that<br>
A: Like how?<br>
G: Like that<br>
Verse 2: Afrika, Mike G<br>
No problem, (why?) because I got it like that<br>
A Baby Bam beat and an African rap<br>
My partner by my side, Sammy B is on the cut<br>
Your DJs chill and chill, but hey, so what?<br>
Nuggets in my pocket, wine in my hand<br>
I got it like that, but you still don't understand<br>
It comes to me natural, it comes to me easy<br>
I just lay back and let the big beat lead me<br>
I never work a day in my life<br>
Single jungle brother, no kids, no wife<br>
100,000 rhymes from one band, that's many<br>
But back where I come from, they ain't worth a penny<br>
You've got a lot of talent, but you fail to see<br>
You paid for yours, I got mine for free<br>
Play in the rain and don't get wet<br>
Walk through the desert and don't even sweat<br>
Play in the snow and don't get cold<br>
I'm just a cool young brother who looks kinda old<br>
Love around the world schoolin' the sound<br>
If I could bet a crowd and get caught us loud<br>
I've got ladies uptown and money on the floor<br>
There's not a thing in the world that I'm askin' for<br>

Chorus 2:<br>
A: Wooh, uh huh<br>
G: Because I got it like that<br>
You wanna know why, brother?<br>
Because I got it like that<br>
A: Uh huh<br>
G: I ain't jokin', I ain't playin', it's just my brother<br>
I got it like that<br>
A: A ha ha<br>
Verse 3: Afrika<br>
Used to be a player, couldn't be trusted<br>
But still in all, I never got busted<br>
Knowin' every part of New York City<br>
I thought it was fun, it used to look witty<br>
I had it all spread out, even one next door<br>
I had it like that, so what ya askin' for?<br>
4 to 5, you see, was my minimum<br>
And every day, I used to go and get with 'em<br>
One for every hour on the hour<br>
One on the way while I was in the shower<br>
It sounds kinda crazy, it sounds kinda bugged<br>
But you see, Afrika was the one they loved<br>
So you see, it got to a point where they didn't care<br>
They didn't wanna give me up, so they agreed to share<br>
Chorus 3:<br>
A: Because I got it like that<br>
G: I hear you, brother, word<br>
A: Because I got it like that<br>
G: Man, you's one baaaaaad jungle brother<br>
A: Like that<br>
Like that<br>
Outro:<br>
A: Uh, wooh, Sammy B, B, you got it like that<br>
I know you got it like that<br>
Yo Mike G from the Jungle Brothers, man<br>
New Orleans got it like that<br>
New York City got it like that<br>
Los Angeles got it like that<br>
Cleveland got it like that<br>
Let me see, who else got it like that?<br>
G: Detroit<br>
A: Who?<br>
G: Detroit<br>
A: Man, yeah, Atlanta got it like that<br>
Philadelphia got it like that<br>
Texas got it like that, let me see<br>
Somebody else got it like that<br>
G: D.C.<br>
A: Yea, D.C., D.C. got it like that<br>
Boston, Miami, I know you got it like that, Miami<br>
G: Word<br>
A: Word up, yo, I'm outta here, you know why?<br>
Both: BECAUSE I GOT IT LIKE THAT<br>
