Playlist Programme<br>
<br>
The DVD also features a way of programming you own playlist of up to 18 videos, which can be looped for ever and also uses the Introductions preference on the Main Menu.<br>
<br>
To use the 'Programme' feature all you need to do is select the track you want to add and press your enter/ok button. The track will be placed into your playlist ready to be watched and you can then add another. The tracks will play in the order in which you add them, and at all times you can see how many spaces you have left in the bottom-right of the menu. You've got up to 18 slots, but don't feel you have to use them all and you can add the same track more than once if you've got a real favourite. When you're happy with your playlist you can choose to play it once or or on a loop, and unless you select the 'clear list' option your playlist will be saved until the DVD is ejected. It couldn't be easier to create your own personal programme.<br>
