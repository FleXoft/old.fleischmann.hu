<B>Polly</B>: Flowers, I just got them from the garden.<BR>

<B>O'Reilly:</B> The problem with you, Mr. Fawlty, is that you worry too much. You keep it up like this, you'll have a stroke before fifty. Stone dead you'll be.<BR>
<B>Basil Fawlty</B>: Suits me.<BR>
<B>O'Reilly:</B> Oh! That's a dreadful thing to say.<BR>
<B>Basil Fawlty</B>: Not at all. Get a bit of peace.<BR>
<B>O'Reilly:</B> Don't be so morbid. The Good Lord made the world so that we could all enjoy ourselves.<BR>
<B>Basil Fawlty</B>: Look, my wife enjoys herself. I worry.<BR>
<B>O'Reilly:</B> Well, let me tell you, if the Lord had meant us to worry, he would have given us things to worry about.<BR>
<B>Basil Fawlty</B>: HE HAS! MY WIFE!! She will be back here in four hours and she can kill a man at ten paces with one blow of her tongue! How am I supposed not to worry?<BR>
<B>O'Reilly:</B> Just remember, Mr. Fawlty, there's always somebody worse off than yourself.<BR>
<B>Basil Fawlty</B>: Is there? Well I'd like to meet him. I could do with a laugh.<BR>
<B>O'Reilly:</B> You'll have to worry for the both of us. I tell you, if the Good Lord---<BR>
<B>Basil Fawlty</B>: ---is mentioned ONCE more, I shall move you closer to him!<BR>

<B>Dante</B>: So who's going to pay for all those Gatorades?<BR>

<B>Dante</B>: Hey, whatcha rent? "Best of Both Worlds"?<BR>
<B>Randal</B>: Hermaphroditic porn. Starlets with both organs. You should see the box. Beautiful chicks with dicks that put mine to shame.<BR>
<B>Dante</B>: And you rented this?<BR>
<B>Randal</B>: Hey, I like to expand my horizons.<BR>

<B>Randal</B>: Which did you like better? "Jedi" or "The Empire Strikes Back"?<BR>
<B>Dante Hicks</B>: "Empire".<BR>
<B>Randal</B>: Blasphemy!<BR>
<B>Dante Hicks</B>: "Empire" had the better ending. I mean, Luke gets his hand cut off, finds out Vader's his father, Han gets frozen and taken away by Boba Fett. It ends on such a down note. I mean, that's what life is, a series of down endings. All "Jedi" had was a bunch of Muppets.<BR>

[reading a magazine]<BR>
<B>Randal</B>: Have you ever wondered how much the average jizz-mopper makes per hour?<BR>
<B>Dante</B>: What's a jizz-mopper?<BR>
<B>Randal</B>: He's the guy that cleans up the nudie booth after each guy jerks off.<BR>
<B>Dante</B>: Nudie booth?<BR>
<B>Randal</B>: Yeah, nudie booth. You've never been in a nudie booth?<BR>
<B>Dante</B>: I guess not.<BR>
<B>Randal</B>: Oh, it's great. There's this glass between you and these chicks, and they put on a show for you for like 10 bucks.<BR>
<B>Dante</B>: What kinda show?<BR>
[Customer walks up to counter with a bottle of glass cleaner and a roll of paper towels.]<BR>
<B>Randal</B>: They do the weirdest, craziest shit you like to see chicks do. They insert things into any opening on their body - ANY opening.<BR>
<B>Dante</B>: Could we not talk about this right now?<BR>
<B>Randal</B>: The jizz-mopper's job is to clean off the glass after each guy shoots a load. I don't know if you noticed, but cum leaves streaks if you don't clean it right away.<BR>
<B>Customer:</B> I will never come to this place again!<BR>
<B>Dante</B>: I'm sorry?<BR>
<B>Customer:</B> Using filthy language in front of the customers, you both should be fired!<BR>
<B>Dante</B>: I'm sorry, I guess we got carried away.<BR>
<B>Customer:</B> I don't know if sorry could make up for it, you've highly offended me.<BR>

<BR><CENTER><IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="../pics/html/black_blur_line.gif" WIDTH=333 HEIGHT=1 ALT="" BORDER="0"></CENTER><BR>
<B>Randal</B>: They never rent anything good either. They always choose the most intellectually devoid stuff on the rack.<BR>
<BR><CENTER><IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="../pics/html/black_blur_line.gif" WIDTH=333 HEIGHT=1 ALT="" BORDER="0"></CENTER><BR>
<B>Dante Hicks</B>: I thought I told you not to be dealing in front of the store.<BR>
<B>Jay:</B> I ain't dealin', man, what you talkin' about?<BR>
<B>Customer:</B> Hey, man, you got anything?<BR>
<B>Jay:</B> Yeah, man, what you want?<BR>
<BR><CENTER><IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="../pics/html/black_blur_line.gif" WIDTH=333 HEIGHT=1 ALT="" BORDER="0"></CENTER><BR>
<B>Customer:</B> Are either one of these any good? [Randal ignores her.] Sir?<BR>
<B>Randal</B>: What?<BR>
<B>Customer:</B> Are either one of these any good?<BR>
<B>Randal</B>: I don't watch movies.<BR>
<B>Customer:</B> Well, have you heard anything about either one of them?<BR>
<B>Randal</B>: I find it's best to stay out of other people's affairs.<BR>
<B>Customer:</B> You mean you've haven't heard anybody say anything about either one of these?<BR>
<B>Randal</B>: Nope.<BR>
[Turns around, then shows Randal the same movies]<BR>
<B>Customer:</B> Well, what about these two?<BR>
<B>Randal</B>: Oh, they suck.<BR>
<B>Customer:</B> These are the same two movies! You weren't paying any attention!<BR>
<B>Randal</B>: No, I wasn't.<BR>
<B>Customer:</B> I don't think your manager would appreciate...<BR>
<B>Randal</B>: I don't appreciate your ruse, ma'am.<BR>
<B>Customer:</B> I beg your pardon?<BR>
<B>Randal</B>: Your ruse; your cunning attempt to trick me.<BR>
<B>Customer:</B> I was only pointing out that you weren't paying any attention to what I was saying!<BR>
<B>Randal</B>: And, I hope it feels good.<BR>
<B>Customer:</B> You hope WHAT feels good?<BR>
<B>Randal</B>: I hope it feels so good to be right. There's nothing more exhilarating than pointing out the shortcomings of others, is there?<BR>
<B>Customer:</B> Well, this is the last time I rent here!<BR>
<B>Randal</B>: You'll be missed.<BR>
<B>Customer:</B> Screw you!<BR>

<B>Silent Bob</B>: You know, there's a million fine looking women in the world, dude. But they don't all bring you lasagna at work. Most of 'em just cheat on you.<BR>
<BR><CENTER><IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="../pics/html/black_blur_line.gif" WIDTH=333 HEIGHT=1 ALT="" BORDER="0"></CENTER><BR>

<BR><CENTER><IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="../pics/html/black_blur_line.gif" WIDTH=333 HEIGHT=1 ALT="" BORDER="0"></CENTER><BR>
<B>Randal</B>: I'm a firm believer in the philosophy of a ruling class. Especially since I rule.<BR>
<BR><CENTER><IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="../pics/html/black_blur_line.gif" WIDTH=333 HEIGHT=1 ALT="" BORDER="0"></CENTER><BR>
<B>Dante</B>: Yeah, I mean aside from the cheating, we were a great couple. I mean that's what high school was about, algebra, bad lunch, and infidelity.<BR>

<B>Veronica</B>: Because I never HAD sex with him.<BR>
<B>Dante Hicks</B>: You sucked his dick!<BR>
<B>Veronica</B>: We went out a few times. We never had sex but we fooled around.<BR>
<B>Dante Hicks</B>: Oh my God, WHY did you tell me you only had sex with three different guys?<BR>
<B>Veronica</B>: Because I DID only have sex with three different guys; that doesn't mean I didn't just go with people.<BR>
<B>Dante Hicks</B>: Oh my God, I feel so nauseous!<BR>
<B>Veronica</B>: I'm sorry, Dante, I thought you understood!<BR>
<B>Dante Hicks</B>: I did understand! I understood that you had sex with three different guys and that's all you said!<BR>
<B>Veronica</B>: Please calm down.<BR>
<B>Dante Hicks</B>: How many?<BR>
<B>Veronica</B>: Dante...<BR>
<B>Dante Hicks</B>: How many dicks have you sucked?<BR>
<B>Veronica</B>: Let it go!<BR>
<B>Dante Hicks</B>: How many?<BR>
<B>Veronica</B>: All right, shut up a second and I'll tell you! Jesus! I didn't freak out like this when you told me how many girls you fucked!<BR>
<B>Dante Hicks</B>: This is different, this is important. How many?<BR>
[long pause as customer buys something]<BR>
<B>Dante Hicks</B>: Well?<BR>
<B>Veronica</B>: Something like... 36.<BR>
<B>Dante Hicks</B>: What? Something like 36?<BR>
<B>Veronica</B>: Lower your voice.<BR>
<B>Dante Hicks</B>: Wait a minute, what is that anyway, something like 36? Does that INCLUDE me?<BR>

<B>Customer:</B> It's important to have a job that makes a difference, boys, that's why I manually masturbate caged animals for artificial insemination.<BR>

<B>Knights of Camelot:</B> We're knights of the Round Table, we dance whene'er we're able. We do routines and chorus scenes with footwork impec-cable, We dine well here in Camelot, we eat ham and jam and Spam a lot. / We're knights of the Round Table, our shows are for-mi-dable. But many times we're given rhymes that are quite un-sing-able, We're opera mad in Camelot, we sing from the diaphragm a lot. / In war we're tough and able, Quite in-de-fa-ti-gable. Between our quests we sequin vests and impersonate Clark Gable / It's a busy life in Camelot [solo] I have to push the pram a lot.<BR>

<B>Minstrel</B>: Bravely bold Sir Robin, brough forth from Camelot. He was not afraid to die, oh brave Sir Robin. He was not at all afraid to be killed in nasty ways, brave, brave, brave, brave Sir Robin. He was not in the least bit scared to being mashed into a pulp, or to have his eyes carved out, and his elbows broken. To have his knee cut split, and his body burned away, and his limbs all hacked and mangled, brave Sir Robin. His head smashed in and heart cut out, and his liver removed, and his bowels unplugged, and his nostrils ripped and his bottom burned off and his penis...<BR>
<B>Sir Robin</B>: THAT'S, that's quite enough, Minstrel.<BR>

<B>Brother Maynard:</B> Skip a bit, Brother...<BR>
<B>Cleric:</B> And the Lord spake, saying, "First shalt thou take out the Holy Pin. Then shalt thou count to three, no more--no less. Three shall be the number thou shalt count, and the number of the counting shall be three. Four shalt thou not count, neither count thou two, excepting that thou then proceed to three. Five is right out. Once the number three, being the third number, be reached, then lobbest thou thy Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch towards thy foe, who, being naughty in my sight, shall snuff it."<BR>

<B>Captain Koons</B>: The way your dad looked at it, this watch was your birthright. He'd be damned if any of the slopes were gonna get their greasy yellow hands on his boy's birthright. So he hid it in the one place he knew he could hide something: his ass. Five long years, he wore this watch up his ass. Then when he died of dysentery, he gave me the watch. I hid this uncomfortable piece of metal up my ass for two years. Then, after seven years, I was sent home to my family. And now, little man, I give the watch to you.<BR>

<B>Jules</B>: Hey, sewer rat may taste like pumpkin pie but I'd never know 'cause I wouldn't eat the filthy motherfuckers. Pig sleep and root in shit. That's a filthy animal. I ain't eat nothin' that ain't got enough sense to disregard its own feces.<BR>
<B>Vincent</B>: How about a dog? Dogs eat their own feces.<BR>
<B>Jules</B>: I don't eat dog either.<BR>
<B>Vincent</B>: Yeah, but do you consider a dog to be a filthy animal?<BR>
<B>Jules</B>: I wouldn't go so far as to call a dog filthy but they're definitely dirty. But, a dog's got personality. Personality goes a long way.<BR>
<B>Vincent</B>: Ah, so by that rationale, if a pig had a better personality, it'd cease to be a filthy animal. Is that true?<BR>

<B>Jules Winnfield</B>: Your life. I'm givin' you that money so I don't hafta kill your ass. You read the Bible?<BR>
<B>Pumpkin</B>: Not regularly.<BR>
<B>Jules Winnfield</B>: There's a passage I got memorized. Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of the darkness. For he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know I am the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon you." I been sayin' that shit for years. And if you ever heard it, it meant your ass. I never really questioned what it meant. I thought it was just a cold-blooded thing to say to a motherfucker before you popped a cap in his ass. But I saw some shit this mornin' made me think twice. Now I'm thinkin': it could mean you're the evil man. And I'm the righteous man. And Mr. .45 here, he's the shepherd protecting my righteous ass in the valley of darkness. Or is could by you're the righteous man and I'm the shepherd and it's the world that's evil and selfish. I'd like that. But that shit ain't the truth. The truth is you're the weak. And I'm the tyranny of evil men. But I'm tryin, Ringo. I'm tryin' real hard to be a shepherd.<BR>
