Kérdések(GyIK)</p>

<p>Q)Why do I suddenly get a &quot;subscript or dimension error&quot; when I start DPBank?<br>
A)Have you recently changed the decimal separator from &quot;dot&quot; to
&quot;comma&quot; (or the other way around)? If so, then you either have to set it back to
what it was, or re-enter your data. This is a problem with the Psion, not DPBank (when it
evaluates numbers).</p>

<p>Q)My data is out of order, what can I do?<br>
A)Up to version 1.5 it could happen that if you were really short on memory, DPBank would
&quot;hang&quot; in the middle of &quot;reconcile upto&quot; operation. This would result
in a wrongly ordered data file. You can fix this yourself by using either JBData or JBSort
to sort the database file (*.d*) on the FIRST field (the date in YYYYMMDD format).</p>

<p>Q)Why can't I open the data file with the standard &quot;Data&quot; application?<br>
A)The data files contain fields different from strings. Data cannot work with such
database files.</p>

<p>Q)Will the program continue to work after the 30 day limit without being registered?<br>
A)Should I really answer that??? Well, basically, yes, but be prepared for some surprise!
If you like the program, please register it.</p>

<p>Q)Why does DPBank get so slow when I have 50+ transactions in one account?<br>
A)Basically, DPBank keeps the transactions in order on the disk and not in memory (that's
why it takes up so little memory). Because of the way Psion have implemented the database
file format, you cannot update a transaction (record) &quot;in place&quot;. Instead, each
time you update a record, the Psion will erase the current one and append the updated
record to the end of the file. Since DPBank needs to have the transactions in order, it
needs to reorder the file manually. This takes quite some time unfortunately :-(</p>

<p>Note: this is only valid for transactions in one account. You can of course have one
account with very few transactions (while another has maybe 100 or more transactions) and
with that one, DPBank will work very quickly.</p>
