<P>100% Natural Relief

<P>Do you suffer from pain due to arthritis, gout, fibromyalgia or
headaches?  Do you know someone who does?

<P>If you answered yes to either question, we would like to tell you about
a 100% natural remedy for this type of pain. Red Tart Cherry Juice
Concentrate contains compounds that provide relief from arthritis, gout,
migraines
and other inflammatory injuries.  Ongoing research reveals that tart
cherries are a rich source of antioxidants that can help fight cancer and
heart
disease.

<P>Here's what Newsweek had to say in a recent article about the remarkable
benefits found in our cherry concentrate.

<P>According to Dr. Muraleedharan Nair at Michigan State University, "lab
tests show that the anthocyanins in tart cherries give 10 times the
anti-inflammatory relief of aspirin, without irritating the stomach.
They are also potent antioxidants."  -- Newsweek 23rd Issue 1999

<P>Here's a quote from a letter we received from Dr. Robert J. Weiss M.D.
Dean Emeritus of the School of Public Health at Columbia University.

<P>"My wife has suffered from pain in her knees from osteoarthritis for
several years and has had no long-term relief. I purchased two quarts of
your sour cherry juice and diluted it eight to one.

<P>Within two days my wife was pain free, and able to lift her knees up
steps without restriction.

<P>As a physician I know that there are many fake cures for all sorts of
diseases around. I should state that while the sour cherry juice is not
a cure, it is a remarkable pain relief which allows almost normal
function for my wife when she was formerly restricted by pain."

<P>We have been selling red tart cherry juice concentrate for about 24
years at our family owned orchard, farm market and processing plant. 
This
product has also been giving noticeable pain relief to those suffering
from
fibromyalgia and migraines.  Recently, we have made this product available
for
ordering on our web site so that people who cannot make the trip to our
store in
Michigan can enjoy the remarkable benefits from this product.

<P>Thank you for taking the time to read this. We hope that this
information will be able to increase the quality of life for you or
someone you know.

<P>To find out more information about red tart cherry juice concentrate, or
information on how to order it, we invite you to call us Toll FREE at
(877) 582-0393
or e-mail us at redcherryJIUCE@yahoo.com.

<p>Hello,
<p>We work with a weight loss physician (also American Board Certified in Family Medicine), who has formulated a topical gel product that has been very successful in the elimination of cellulite fat.

<p>This cellulite-reducing topical gel product is simply amazing! You literally have to measure yourself before and after using this product to believe it. 
Testimonials are flooding into this physician s office from people who have lost both inches and pounds, after just the first week of using the system. Here is just one of them:

<p>"I lost nine and half inches total, after my very first week of applying the  gels. After my second and third weeks of application, I lost an
additional  18 inches. My inches loss, as well as my weight loss, accelerated  tremendously, when I started using the weight loss pills
that came in my  pak. In three months, I have lost a total of 42 inches and 22 pounds! 
Whats  more, I have more energy than ever, I sleep better and I feel so much  healthier. Presently, my friends, having seen the great
results I have had  with Dr As Cellulite Reducing & Weight Loss System, are now using the  system as well. One of them lost an
astounding 18 inches total after her  very first week of applying the gels. Her self esteem is so much improved.
