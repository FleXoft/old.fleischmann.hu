on a Hi-MD, with a Core Sound Binaural Microphone Set, from row 6 middle (1 seat left of)

Homeland is in one flow, nothing is cut out, there is no editing, I made seperate tracks 
also for applause in the end, tracks 19 and 21, as some like to play/keep them and some don't 
When you burn your CD please note, make 0 sec between these files/tracks
I found the track names in various places on the net, like in several reviews that I found and translated

I wish to thank Laurie Anderson for outstanding words, music and performance, really breathtaking,
so very true, beautiful and soft, sharp and strong, my hero you are and my lifeline too, thank you!
