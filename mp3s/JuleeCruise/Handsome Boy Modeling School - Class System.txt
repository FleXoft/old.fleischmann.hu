Correct

Pharrel :
La la la la la la la

Julie Cruise :
Yes, I got it all
Prestige, class, fortune
Good help is so hard to find
Except my tennis pro
(My husband doesn't know)

Pharrel :
They're all trapped in the system
Unbeknownst to them they're trapped with no glass
Hello there

They're all trapped in the system
Unbeknownst to them they're trapped with no glass
Hello there

Julie Cruise :
I give to many charities
It's just a tax write off
They breed, just like rats it seems
Why don't they get a job

Pharrel :
They're all trapped in the system
Unbeknownst to them they're trapped with no glass
Hello there

They're all trapped in the system
Unbeknownst to them they're trapped with no glass
Hello there

Woman :
I mean really it's so simple for them
I mean we're the ones paying the rent
And the food and..all the taxes
My God what more do they want

Julie Cruise :
Money Money Money Money Money
Money Money Money Money Money
It makes the world go round

Pharrel :
They're all trapped in the system
Unbeknownst to them they're trapped with no glass
Hello there

They're all trapped in the system
Unbeknownst to them they're trapped with no glass
Hello there

They're all trapped in the system
Unbeknownst to them they're trapped with no glass
Hello there

They're all trapped in the system
Unbeknownst to them they're trapped with no glass
Hello there

Woman :
I was bred to be special
You're not one of us
So don't try to fit in
We'll just laugh you away

I get meloncholy sometimes
My shrink says im repressed
I'm just like my mother I guess
Same class, wealth...bland husband
